<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td><em>Fairmont Maldives Sirru Fen Fushi</em>&nbsp;has unveiled a series of new sculptures within the Coralarium &#8211; the Maldives’ first and only coral regeneration project in the form of an underwater art installation.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Conceptualised by celebrated British environmentalist and eco-artist, Jason deCaires Taylor, the abstract sculptures are inspired by the natural beauty of the coral reef and have been designed to imitate the ethereal formation of coral colonies. Rising from ten, semi-submerged plinths within the Coralarium, the installation aims to raise awareness of the threatened ecosystem, educate guests about the underwater world and rehabilitate the reef. Rising from the sea into the sky, the tessellated sculptures act as a visual connector between the aquatic world, and the land.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Perched in the largest resort lagoon in the Maldives,&nbsp;<em>Fairmont Maldives Sirru Fen Fushi</em>&nbsp;plays home to an abundance of marine life, from manta rays and turtles to bottlenose dolphins and over 250 species of tropical fish. Now, guests can get even closer to nature, as they explore these sculptures and the verdant aquatic life that dwells amongst them, accompanied by a resident marine biologist, or as part of the property’s specially curated evening&nbsp;&nbsp;snorkelling tours.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>The Coralarium structure, and the sculptures within, act as an artificial reef, encouraging local marine life to make it a home. Up to 5 meters&nbsp;&nbsp;tall, each one of the soaring sculptures is constructed of more than 500 ceramic ‘starfish’ that have been specifically designed to attract a variety of fish and crustaceans &#8211; the hard shells catch and hold biomass, or ‘fish food’, which encourage coral larvae to attach and thrive, while nooks and dark cubbyholes in the structures provide a hiding place for a variety of fish and shellfish. Each sculpture is brought to life through its union with the life that attaches to it, transforming them from concrete to textured, living organisms.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>As one of the world’s most celebrated ‘underwater naturalists’, Taylor’s works become an integral part of the local eco-system, created with non-toxic, marine-grade compounds, free from harmful pollutants. The steel Coralarium structure, first installed in 2018, has quickly become inundated with marine life, and adventurous guests eager to discover the thriving underwater world. Hard corals, sponges and thousands of schooling fish now live within its walls that are perforated with a coral pattern to allow beams of light to illuminate the sculptures.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Strategically placed to lead snorkelers into various ‘zones’ of the Coralarium, the sculptures can be explored from a sea-scaped coral pathway, that leads from the 200 meter&nbsp;&nbsp;infinity pool at the heart of the island – the longest in the Maldives. Diving adventures and snorkelling sessions with the marine biologist showcase Fairmont Maldives’ best diving spots, right at the five-mile-long house reef, home to many manta ray cleaning stations. Those inspired by Taylor’s installation can even create their own marine-inspired masterpiece in the on-site art studio, or plant their own coral, which they can see flourish as they revisit in years to come.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Having opened its doors in May 2018,&nbsp;<em>Fairmont Maldives Sirru Fen Fushi</em>&nbsp;is an idyllic island paradise dedicated to educating the next generation of eco-conscious travellers. With the coral regeneration project, educational exploration of the coral reef, in-house marine biologists, a water distillery and, in early 2020, the installation of solar panels, the resort strives to protect and restore the wellbeing of local ecosystems.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>For close to 30 years,&nbsp;<em>Fairmont Hotels &amp; Resorts</em>&nbsp;has been committed to proactively protecting local environments through its award-winning Fairmont Sustainability Partnership, now part of Accor’s Planet21 program.&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the world&#8217;s first hotel companies to embrace environmental stewardship, Fairmont has been at the forefront of embracing responsible tourism practices and remains committed to improving the overall well-being of its local communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ongoing global initiatives include reductions in energy and water consumption, waste generation and carbon emissions, sustainable practices related to design, proactive construction and procurement policies, conservation efforts in support of bee species and other wildlife, and community outreach through local groups and partnerships.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Global lifestyle brand Nobu Hospitality, founded by Nobu Matsuhisa, Robert De Niro and Meir Teper, is pleased to announce the opening of Nobu Hotel Barcelona. The new Nobu Hotel features Barcelona&#8217;s very first Nobu restaurant, an achingly stylish design, a built-in celebrity following and breath-taking views of one of the world’s most exciting cities.</p>



<p><br>Nobu Restaurant and Bar, the sky-high dining destination situated on the 23<sup>rd</sup> floor, will delight and astound; the iconic restaurant’s dishes including Black Miso Cod are on the menu, along with some new flavours and influences from Spain. Also unique to the hotel is the eclectic lobby dining spot, Kozara, which serves masterfully executed Japanese inspired Catalan tapas, paired with sake or whisky-based cocktails. And for those not wanting to venture too far from their rooms, guests can enjoy a wide selection of dishes from the Nobu in-room dining menu.</p>



<p>The Rockwell Group has designed the interiors to reflect a Japanese influence, introducing Kintsugi – a craft where cracked pottery is repaired with lacquer mixed with precious metals to create collages, textures and spaces throughout the hotel &#8211; all cleverly paired with incredible works of art inspired by Catalonia’s legendary maestro, Gaudi.</p>



<p>Located in the Catalan neighbourhood of Eixample, visitors can discover the hidden spots of the city through the hotel’s savvy concierge team; from founders Robert De Niro’s favourite restaurant to the bar Chef Nobu Matsuhisa’s visits when he’s in town and Meir Teper’s recommendation of where to dance. Just a short stroll from the hotel is Plaza de España, Barcelona’s buzzy La Rambla and the main railway station for high speed links to Madrid, Paris, Lyon and Marseille.</p>



<p>Coming soon, the hotel will welcome a wellness centre complete with a gym and spa, a Kozara terrace for alfresco dining, auditorium and a Café, serving fresh barista-style coffee. Together with the Spanish hospitality group, Selenta, owned by Jordi Mestre, Nobu Hotel Barcelona offers guests and locals a super cool, luxury lifestyle experience with a genuine Catalan feel.</p>



<p><em>Room rates at Nobu Hotel Barcelona start from €250 per night in a Deluxe Skyline Room.&nbsp;</em><br><br><em>For more information, visit&nbsp;</em><a href="http://www.barcelona.nobuhotels.com"><em>www.barcelona.nobuhotels.com</em></a></p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Globally famous for launching Asia’s most sustainable hotel,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.theakyra.com/bangkok/sukhumvit/" target="_blank">akyra TAS Sukhumvit</a>, the AKARYN Hotel Group pledges to go completely single-use plastic free by June 2019 across the entire hotel group. Leading the charge in eco-luxury, AHG is the ideal option for travellers with a conscience.</p></blockquote>



<p>Recent winners of the ‘Green Steps’ award at the 2018 Responsible Thailand Awards, Founding MD, Anchalika Kijkanakorn comments:&nbsp;<em>‘it’s an honour to be recognised for our contribution to eco- friendly travel. It is our goal to become fully sustainable throughout AHG as soon as possible.’</em></p>



<p>Eco-led efforts across the group will include sourcing glass bottles and removing all single-use plastic from the bars. As well as this, stylish stainless steel akyra water bottles are handed to guests on arrival, which can be refilled anytime during their stay at the self-service water stations conveniently located on every floor. Additionally, toiletry products are presented in locally manufactured celadon containers filled with essential oils-based products and bio-degradable bin bags are used in rooms. For those wanting to indulge in some retail therapy outside of the resorts, special shopping totes can be found in the wardrobes to encourage guests to refuse plastic bags when shopping, promoting change even whilst outside of the hotel.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>This isn’t the only ammo in AHG’s battle against climate change. Their very own charity, the Pure Blue Foundation has been helping raise funds to aid multi-faceted marine conservation efforts for the last decade. Amongst others, initiatives include coral reef restoration in Koh Samui to marine turtle conservation at Phang Nga, near Phuket, via the turtle sanctuary in Thai Muang, where hundreds of endangered leatherback turtles have been raised and released into the Andaman Sea.</p>



<p>What’s more, aiming to inspire and educate a generation of eco-conscious travellers, AHG are also holding ‘Train &amp; Sustain’ bootcamps at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theakyra.com/phuket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>akyra Beach Club Phuket</em></a>, their contemporary waterfront resort overlooking the Andaman Sea. The three-day health and sustainability boot camp combines group activities to support the local environment such as cleaning local beaches of rubbish and educating children on the consequences of using plastic, with yoga, fitness classes and spa treatments – reinforcing the hotel group’s key commitments to responsible tourism and wellbeing.</p>
