<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Why It&#8217;s Important and How to Get to the Top</h2>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">The Basics </h2>



<h3>What is SEO?</h3>



<p>SEO stands for ‘search engine optimisation’ and is the practice of increasing both the quantity and quality of traffic driven to your website, as well as brand exposure, through non-paid (also known as ‘organic’) search engine results. Ultimately, SEO is about understanding what people are searching for, the answers they&#8217;re looking for, the words that they use and the type of content they want to read. Knowing and understanding the answers to these questions allows you to connect with the people who are searching for the services you offer.</p>



<h3>Why is it important?</h3>



<p>Search engines scour the internet (billions of pieces of content) and evaluate thousands of factors to find out which content is most likely to answer the searcher&#8217;s query. Search engines do this by discovering and cataloguing all of the available content (web pages, PDFs, images, videos) via a process known as ‘crawling and indexing’ and then ordering it by how well it matches the query, in a process referred to as ‘ranking’.</p>



<p>While paid advertising, social media and other online platforms can generate traffic, the majority of traffic is actually driven by search engines. Organic search results cover more digital real estate, appear more credible to searchers, and receive more clicks than paid advertisements. When set up correctly, SEO can continue to pay dividends over time. If you provide a solid piece of content that deserves to rank for the right keywords, your traffic can snowball over time, whereas advertising needs continuous funding to send traffic to your site. </p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Writing for SEO</h2>



<h4><strong>Audience </strong></h4>



<p>Think about your audience carefully; who is searching for your website and what do they want to read? The ultimate goal of a blog post is to answer a searcher’s query, and content that’s highly ranked is always user focused. Think about questions a reader could have about the subject you’re covering, and whether or not you answer them within the text. </p>



<h4>Keywords</h4>



<p>Find
the keywords that relate to your expertise and map these keywords to search
intent – that means to create content that is highly relevant to your keywords.
Optimising your blog posts is not necessarily about cramming as many keywords
into your posts as possible (this can actually damage SEO) but using keywords
throughout your content in a way that doesn’t feel forced. Focus on one or two
keywords – or key phrases &#8211; that keep your post focused on the intent, or
goals, of your audience. </p>



<p>Long-tail keywords rank higher than short keywords (i.e. ‘luxury travel PR’ would rank higher than ‘PR’) as there is less competition but a higher search volume. Most of your keywords should be three words or over i.e. ‘How to write for SEO’, ‘a guide to luxury travel PR’, ‘what is crisis communications’ or ‘hotel PR company’. To rank higher in search results, include your keyword(s) in the title of your article, headers, tags and within the body copy, URL and meta description.</p>



<h4>Relevance</h4>



<p>While it’s important to come up with content topics based on the targeted keywords you discovered and what your audience wants to know, be sure to ride the wave of trending topics, and make sure your article is searchable. What’s trending in your industry, and how are other brands responding to it? Are there other blogs you can link to? If you’re an expert in your field – or at least show it through your writing &#8211; and your post remains relevant to the topic, it’ll rank higher in search engines.</p>



<h4>Structure</h4>



<p> SEO content that shoots to the top of SERPs (search engine results page) is incredibly readable. A clear structure helps the reader to easily read your post and grasp the core message – and it helps Google rank your article. Start by outlining the structure of your post; it should have some sort of introduction, in which you introduce your topic using the keywords, a body in which the main message is written and a conclusion – a summary of the most important ideas. It also pays to use paragraphs – don’t start each sentence on a new line, but make sure sentences are easy to read and digestible as it’ll help SEO ranking.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photo-1557774394-de53f40ccb02-800x1200.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-3253" srcset="https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photo-1557774394-de53f40ccb02-800x1200.jpeg 800w, https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photo-1557774394-de53f40ccb02-512x768.jpeg 512w, https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photo-1557774394-de53f40ccb02-768x1152.jpeg 768w, https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photo-1557774394-de53f40ccb02.jpeg 934w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<h4>Length</h4>



<p>Your article should be at least 300 words long in order to rank in search engines. Google likes long articles (750 &#8211; 2,000 words) and they rank more easily than short, but if your article is too long, strays from the point and ‘waffles’ – and therefore not so easy to read – there’s a chance the huge volume of text will make readers click away. The optimum length of a blog post is around 1,500 &#8211; 2,000 words but it must be well-written, with easy-to-digest sentences, effective use of images and clearly labelled headers.</p>



<h4>Headers</h4>



<p>This relates back to both the length, structure and readability of your content. Ensuring that the text is broken into digestible paragraphs that are clearly labelled with headers (h1, h2, h3, h4) will mean content ranks higher. Every page should only have one h1-tag to make the title of the article clear to Google.</p>



<h4>Links</h4>



<p><strong>Anchor Text:</strong> anchor
text is the clickable text in a hyperlink (often <a href="http://foxcomms.com/">blue and underlined</a>).
SEO-friendly anchor text is succinct and relevant to the page it’s linking to.
A highly relevant link can improve the likelihood of your webpage (and the page
you’re linking to) ranking for queries related to the topic, as the words used
within the anchor text help a search engine bot to better understand your
webpage.</p>



<p><strong>External Links</strong>: linking
to trustworthy and informative material appears more authorative and can help
search engines figure out what your content is about. With that, an external
link is more valuable if it links to popular and highly ranked pages that are
relevant to your content.</p>



<p><strong>Backlinks</strong>: A backlink is created when one website links to another (also known as ‘inbound links’) and are important to SEO because they represent a ‘vote of confidence’ &#8211; signalling to search engines that others value your content. Backlinks from trustworthy websites are more valuable, so make sure the sites you link to in your articles have authority. <strong>Internal Links</strong>: internal links are hyperlinks that direct readers to a target page on your own website. Internal links help readers stay on your site for longer and ensure that, if your article is picked up by another source, it’ll contain a link back to your website. The easiest way to insert internal links is to use them as a call-to-action i.e. click here to see our other travel clients.</p>



<h4>Meta Descriptions</h4>



<p>The meta description is the short paragraph of text placed in the HTML of a webpage that describes its content – it’s what shows up as an excerpt when Google displays your page as a result to searchers. Optimised meta descriptions also often mention the content’s keyword(s) up-front. The more descriptive and relevant the description is to the content, the more likely someone will click onto your website. Make sure your most important keywords for the webpage are in the description (but don’t overuse keywords) treat it like an advert for your content and make sure it’s no more than 160 characters long.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photo-1561188968-cb31be402a9c-1806x1200.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-3254" srcset="https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photo-1561188968-cb31be402a9c-1806x1200.jpeg 1806w, https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photo-1561188968-cb31be402a9c-1024x680.jpeg 1024w, https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photo-1561188968-cb31be402a9c-768x510.jpeg 768w, https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photo-1561188968-cb31be402a9c-1536x1020.jpeg 1536w, https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photo-1561188968-cb31be402a9c-2048x1360.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1806px) 100vw, 1806px" /></figure>



<h4>Visuals</h4>



<p>Visuals
are just as important as compelling text. Make sure the images you choose are
relevant to your text, and label them as such – making sure captions are
succinct but accurately describe the content. Using a few high-quality images,
over random, distorted ones, ranks higher in SEO.</p>



<p>Images can be optimised so that they appear crisp and clear, but don’t take forever to load (and therefore lessen dwell time) – images you upload should be a maximum of 1920px wide to display in high resolution for both mobile and desktop. You can use a simple online recourse such as <a href="https://picresize.com/">picresize.com</a> to edit the size of high-resolution images.</p>



<p>It’s not just great images that helps with SEO. Websites with video content are becoming more prevelant to Google’s algorithms. Video can lower bounce rate, meaning people stay on your website for longer, and tell Google that a website is of a higher quality. Where possible, use <a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a> to upload videos onto the internet, then embed them into your website copy using the easy-to-find link Vimeo provides. </p>



<h4>Spread the Word</h4>



<p>This
is the easiest point to action – make sure the content you’ve written is cross
promoted on relevant social media channels – Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and
LinkedIn &#8211; using the keyword(s) and a succinct description. Being present
across channels in this way is a great way to reach a wider audience and
generate buzz for your brand. </p>



<p>Social media channels also rank in search engines, so it’s important to ensure that keywords and content are consistent across platforms. </p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Fox Communications&#8217; Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Instagram</h2>



<p>Social media is about sharing, communicating and publishing knowledge and information online. It encourages openness by way of commenting, posting and following, and people can participate in these interactive online conversations by using a variety of channels. It&#8217;s an invaluable tool for brands to promote their business, create key relationships with followers and build reputation &#8211; but most importantly, it&#8217;s completely free to use. </p>



<p>Throughout this series, we&#8217;ll explore the following platforms; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> &#8211; the DO’s &amp; DON’T’s for brands and businesses, how they can put advice into practice and the essentials of good social media. Starting this week with our Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Instagram. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">&#8211;</p>



<h3 class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Instagram &#8211; The Basics </strong></h3>



<p>At its most basic, Instagram is a social networking app made for sharing photos and videos and with more than 1billion* monthly active users. With 500million using the platform every day, it is one of the most popular social networks worldwide, behind Facebook and YouTube. </p>



<p>75% of the app’s users are under 35-years-old, so it&#8217;s a great marketing tool for targeting a younger demographic. With the app becoming increasingly popular, an estimated 71% of US businesses claim they use Instagram for business, and 7 out of 10 hashtags on the app are branded. What’s more is that more than 80% of businesses consider Instagram engagement as the most important metric – so it is key for brands to get it right. </p>



<p>Use of influencers for social media marketing purposes continues to grow and between February 2018 – February 2019, the number of Instagram influencers using #ad grew by 133% (Socialbakers, 2019). Influencers are a great way for brands to engage with large, sought-after audiences, however partnerships should be carefully thought through and always aligned with the brand’s core values – more than ever consumers are switched on to influencer marketing and can sense when collaborations are genuine or if they’re purely for payment. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Picture-221.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3093" srcset="https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Picture-221.png 864w, https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Picture-221-768x508.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" /></figure>



<p>Instagram stories are another important tool for brands and businesses. Launched in August 2016, this game-changing feature allows users to take photos and videos which disappear after 24-hours. Since launching this feature, 500million Instagram accounts use Instagram stories every day (Instagram, 2018), and a third of the most viewed stories are from businesses. They are a great way to interact with followers, by replying and reposting stories, as well as featuring content that might not be quite worthy of the grid. </p>



<p>For brands, Instagram has never been more important, with 80% of users deciding whether to buy a product or service with help of the app. Whether it be via the brand’s own Instagram page, through an influencer’s recommendation or by searching for hashtags and geotags, discoverability on the app is crucial, especially when targeting millennials. &nbsp;By following the tips found within our <em>Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Instagram</em>, you can make a start in creating the perfect profile for your business/ brand. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">&#8211;</p>



<h3 class="has-text-align-center"><strong>The Essentials of Good Instagram</strong></h3>

<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Fox Communications&#8217; seven step plan </h3>



<p>In times of uncertainty, it is clearer than ever that each and every brand is vulnerable to crisis. Stepping up to the role of leadership when necessary is vitally important and developing a crisis communications plan should be part of every public relations strategy. </p>



<p>As the name suggests, a crisis communication plan is an outlined strategy surrounding how to communicate with employees, clients, and customers during a difficult situation that impacts a business in a significant way.  From a global Coronavirus pandemic, to a stock market crash, political unrest, an on-site tragedy, or spurious allegations against your business, a plan of action is necessary in order to mitigate financial and reputational risk. It&#8217;s imperative that if and when a crisis arises, organisations are able to respond quickly and confidently, so that their communication throughout the process is seamless.</p>



<p>Crisis and reputation management continues to evolve as the state of journalism is rapidly changing. The way we consume news and the use of citizen journalism means that news is now reported 24-hours a day, instantaneously – through TV, radio, social media, instant news apps etc.</p>



<p>Here are some steps you should take, to prepare for ‘before, during and after’ an incident.  Every company is different, and plans may vary, but taken from our experience in luxury travel PR, there are many core factors which are essential.</p>



<h4>Crisis Communications Messaging </h4>



<p>Ensure your brand story, key messages and facts are up to date, so that they can be shared quickly. Any messaging should still be aligned to your brand’s core values.</p>



<h4>Create Your Crisis Communications Team</h4>



<p> This can vary, but it usually includes senior executives, heads of divisions, your PR agency and marketing team.</p>



<h4>Anticipate Crisis</h4>



<p>Once you have a team, bring them together to plan and anticipate different crises scenarios, as well as assigning everyone with roles and responsibilities.</p>



<h4>Identify a Spokesperson</h4>



<p>It tends often be the CEO, but it is also worth having a team of spokespeople ready, dependent on the incident and who is also right to talk to media. Ensure that your spokespeople are media trained – they need to be prepared and ready to respond.</p>



<h4>Listening Tools</h4>



<p>Set up listening tools to monitor all channels for mentions of your brand, so negative mentions are be seen and dealt with in real time.</p>



<h4>Develop Holding Statements</h4>



<p>An effective holding statement will buy an organisation some crucial time until it is able to get a better understanding of what has happened and issue something more detailed. It will also help prevent the spread of rumour and speculation.  <br><br>While it will be beneficial to include as much information as you can, some effective holding statements just acknowledge that something has gone wrong. Holdings statements should include the following: Empathy, Action, Reassurance and Details.</p>



<h4>Create your PR Crisis Communications Plan</h4>



<p>This needs
to includes the crisis team’s roles and responsibilities, as well as contact
details, a checklist, a chain of command and approval process, updated brand
fact and messaging and draft statements. It may also include risk assessment
charts, financial assessment charts, emergency response plans, and checklists.</p>



<p>Unless you’re a large organisation with extensive budget and resources, it may be challenging to create thorough and actionable Crisis Communication Plans for every eventuality. But it is best practice to have a general overview of how your business would and should react no matter challenges you encounter.  </p>



<p>Above all else &#8211; remember: <br><br>&#8211; Tell it all, tell it fast, tell the truth<br>&#8211; Establish and control the facts<br>&#8211; Harness your own channels of communication<br>&#8211; Tone is important: show your human side, particularly for interviews<br><br>Remember, every brand faces crises and that part remains out of your control. Ultimately, however, what people remember is not so much the &#8216;what&#8217; that happened, but the way it was handled afterwards.</p>

<h3 class="has-text-align-center">The Social Media Survival Strategies You Need to Know </h3>



<p>In times like these, it can be incredibly challenging for brands to find their voice on social media. Getting the balance between pre-COVID posting and the right tone for a global pandemic that includes travel bans etc, is a difficult ask for everyone.  <br><br>But now more than ever, it’s important. There has never been a better time to offer inspiration, compassion, guidance and assurance; building relationships that will last long after this crisis is over.</p>



<h3 class="has-text-align-center">The Seven Commandments of Social Content During COVID-19</h3>



<h4> Define Your Purpose</h4>



<p>One thing that’s really going to come out of a global lockdown, is a brand’s purpose. What are you doing for the community and the world as a whole? What are your sustainability commitments or transparency on supply chains? Set out clear goals and consider how these can be conveyed via social media whether it’s by ‘loving’ what suppliers are doing for their communities or what staff are doing philanthropically.</p>



<h4>Don&#8217;t Deny the Obvious</h4>



<p>Alluding to the current climate may seem self-defeating for a hotel – but it’s not. Travel bans or not, demonstrating empathy is vital and shows solidarity; we are all in this together.  The right move is to sway things towards more personal communication, post less frequently than usual, but allude to the situation through positive messaging, support for the community, charitable initiatives and aspirational imagery.   </p>



<h4>Get Creative</h4>



<p>Social media can be an effective tool to encourage engagement, increase brand loyalty and connect with your clients at a time when face-to-face contact isn’t possible. Brands with strong aspirational imagery especially i.e. those in travel, are well placed to offer some much-needed escapism. Hotels can host travel quizzes, sponsor creative competitions or encourage followers and team members to share their favourite travel memory and use a relevant tag. </p>



<h4>Encourage Activity</h4>



<p>With the world in lockdown, most are not able to follow a ‘normal’ exercise regime or visit the gym; social media has become a thriving space to share at-home workouts, fitness inspiration, healthy recipes and health and wellbeing support. Why not host at home workouts by a member of your fitness team, a family fitness challenge, or online yoga or meditation classes demonstrated by a member of the fitness/ spa team. </p>



<h4>Show Expertise</h4>



<p>Position your brand as a market leader and engage with followers on a more personal level, utilising the experts you already have at your fingertips to share tips and tricks that are replicable at home. Teach followers using IG how to make signature cocktails at home, &nbsp;offer cooking classes with your chef, (looking at immune boosting ingredients), or utilise your interiors/ design experts or housekeeping team for decorating tutorials or advice on how to make the perfect, hotel-style bed<strong> </strong></p>



<h4>Promote Mindfulness</h4>



<p>Stay relatable and show empathy, in a way designed to be authentic and real. Consider creating video content to promote relaxation – maybe a time-lapse video of your on-site sunset, or waves at the beach that can be used to encourage a sense of calmness. Seek out inspirational quotes and consider your captions carefully. Remain sensitive to the current climate, promote positivity and hope, and encourage followers to share their favourite quotes ensuring you are tagged. Ask followers to share how they’re keeping mentally strong during lockdown. </p>



<h4>Aim to Inspire</h4>



<p>All but non-essential travel might be on hold for now, but consumers can still dream about where they’ll be investing their time in the future. Use the inspiring content you’ve created and think about what’s trending for 2021 and beyond. You can join the conversation through hashtags such as &nbsp;#ArmchairAdventures or #Daydreaming &#8211; or National Geographic&#8217;s recently launched <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/stay-inspired">#StayInspired campaign</a> &#8211; whilst showcasing the beautiful interiors or views from your property to inspire future travels. You can also offer virtual tours from video content on file that can be used to inspire wanderlust i.e. film the sunset and post alongside a positive message or show followers around the gardens/ beach. Also lend support to local charities and front-line workers and share the love on social. </p>



<p>As the world copes with this global pandemic it is increasingly clear that it is touching all of us &#8211; we really are all in this all together.  And there is real power and connection in showing that on social media.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="http://globetrender.com/">Globetrender</a>, a digital magazine and travel trend forecasting agency, has published its first, <em>Future of Luxury Travel Forecast: 2020-2025</em>, in association with Cookson Adventures, the leading specialists in ultra-luxury experiential travel, with a focus on conservation and sustainability.  </p>



<p>The inaugural report was unveiled at an event held at The Conduit, London on Tuesday 11<sup>th</sup> February, in partnership with Fox Communications and Verb Brands. Highlighting key findings of the forecast, the event also included a panel discussion with John O’Ceallaigh, consultant and founder of <em>Lute</em>, Tom Marchant, co-founder of <em>Black Tomato</em>, Thierry Teyssier, founder of <em>700,000 Heures </em>and Nigel Goode, designer and director Of <em>PriestmanGoode</em>.</p>



<p>From Space Tourism and Immortality Retreats, to Radical Sabbaticals and Ephemeral Hotels, the 70-plus page report reveals 25 eye-opening, highly specific macro trends that are setting the agenda for the next five years of luxury travel. It also shares interviews with industry innovators and thought leaders who reveal their insights and predictions for the years ahead.</p>



<p>The report, which costs £195 to download from globetrender.com, comes at a time when the luxury travel industry is facing impressive growth. According to <a href="https://globetrender.com/downloads/future-of-luxury-travel-forecast-2020-2025/">Grand View Research, Inc</a>, the luxury travel industry will be worth more than US$2.5 trillion by 2025, up from US$1.8 trillion in 2018.</p>



<p>This is a consequence not only of a growing number of worldwide millionaires and billionaires, but the rise of the middle classes, who are becoming ever-more wealthy and aspirational. The new decade will also see a huge shift away from materialism to experientialism as drivers of status, which only heightens the value of travel.</p>



<p>Jenny Southan, Globetrender’s editor and founder, said: “A few decades ago, most people agreed luxury travel meant staying in five-star hotels, eating in Michelin-star restaurants and riding around in limousines, things that were only attainable to the truly monied. Now, it is no longer satisfying to be isolated and pampered in a way that means they rarely engage with the ‘real world’ around them.</p>



<p>“Today, not only has luxury travel been democratised to some
degree but the very definition of it has become expanded. In the 2020s, it will
be trips that offer life enhancement, inner transformation, cultural
appreciation and physical graft that hold the most desire and social currency.
Wealthy travellers are becoming more intrepid, even going so far as to seek
discomfort.</p>



<p>“The trends we have identified in this report all reflect these things in different ways, whether it’s seeking out time in the wilderness, taking extended career breaks to travel the world, working on conservation projects or going into space.”</p>



<p>Luxury travel journalist, consultant and co-author of the Globetrender <em>Future of Luxury Travel Forecast: 2020-2025</em>, John O’Ceallaigh, said: “The old conventions and standards that defined luxury travel are losing ground as trailblazers and disruptors respond to changing consumer sentiments and demands with new initiatives and innovations. </p>



<p>“Researching and co-authoring this report served as a powerful reminder for me that change is full of opportunity and true creativity and credibility is rewarded. That seismic change is going to ripple through the luxury-travel sector in the coming years is a certainty – it&#8217;s an exciting time for the industry.”</p>



<h2>Here are excerpts from three defining luxury travel trends for 2020-2025: </h2>



<h4>Space Tourism</h4>



<p>Space tourism
is undeniably the most thrilling luxury travel trend for the new decade,
offering private citizens the chance to take part in truly revolutionary
extra-terrestrial journeys, without having to train to become professional
astronauts.</p>



<p>Having unveiled its Spaceport America departure terminal in 2019, as well as civilian space suits designed by Under Armour, Virgin Galactic plans to launch debut flights to the edge of space, 50 miles up, in 2020. Meanwhile, Zero To Infinity envisions taking people on a 4.5-hour journey, 22 miles above Earth, in a zero-emission helium balloon called Bloon by the end of 2021. </p>



<h4>Radical Sabbaticals</h4>



<p>In response
to increasing demand for career breaks with purpose, London-based tour operator
Original Travel has developed a sabbatical division and constructs extended
itineraries that focus on specific goals, be they finally learning to dance the
tango with the experts in Argentina or assisting a turtle-conservation project
in Costa Rica. They typically last from three to 12 months. </p>



<p>Aardvark Safaris’ so called “sensational sabbaticals” similarly emphasise environmentalism and sustainability, and might involve a months-long expedition through African reserves to assist at a Kenyan rhino sanctuary before joining the team at Singita’s offering in Tanzania to learn more about the latest anti-poaching strategies. </p>



<h4><strong>Ephemeral Hotels</strong></h4>



<p>Luxury thrives when it provides a sense of exclusivity, so what could be more desirable than a never-to-be-repeated hotel, resort or glamping stay that is yours alone? A number of emerging limited-edition accommodation concepts have made this thought a central tenet of their offering, and are delivering their privileged guests a range of hyper-personalised experiences while they’re in residence, to boot.  Take 700,000 Heures, which emerged – discreetly – as the “world’s first wandering hotel” in late 2018. Every six months, the concept “pops up” in a unique and remarkable private abode for a one-off residency. In 2020, it will be going to Japan, taking over an historic temple in Koyasan and a traditional house in a fishing village, with stays costing €2,500 a night.  </p>

<p><em>Lysbeth Fox reflects on the resilience of the travel industry, and highlights just a few of the many charitable actions brands are taking to help their communities, and each other.</em></p>



<p>One of the benefits I’ve found in this enforced moment of pause, is the opportunity to reflect on the ways in which we are all connected. For in spite of the differences that divide us, in this crisis we are united. In every walk of life, regardless of status or race or privilege, all are affected; no one escapes unscathed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And with this is mind I (like many others), have been looking at ways to use my abilities and access in order to help the greater good. I have tasked my team to take a day each week to help their local community or NHS volunteer during working hours, which is something we all feel passionate about undertaking.&nbsp;As I investigated other ways to support and help, I was heartened to see how many businesses are already doing amazing things.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of this I am certain. That whilst this current crisis is difficult and painful, it also represents great opportunity to make a difference when it’s greatly needed – to remind the world that we stand together, to bring light into darkness and&nbsp;to answer real need.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s companies like these that make me proud to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;world&nbsp;that truly comes together and shows good can be achieved through corporations:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://all.accor.com/united-kingdom/index.en.shtml">Accor</a> launches emergency response platform to provide NHS, key workers and disadvantaged people with accommodation solutions in UK. So far more than 80 hotels in the UK have opened their doors to help those in need during this crisis.</li><li><a href="https://deliveroo.co.uk">Deliveroo</a> pledges 500,000 free meals for NHS workers and is changing its app to allow customers to donate funds for buying meals for doctors and nurses</li><li><a href="https://uk.burberry.com">Burberry</a> has joined the UK’s fight against coronavirus by using its expertise to help the NHS, the luxury fashion house has begun producing protective gowns for healthcare workers tackling the outbreak</li><li><a href="https://www.veeve.com/en-gb/">Veeve</a>, the short-term luxury rental collection&nbsp;provider&nbsp;is&nbsp;offering&nbsp;free accommodation to front line NHS key workers</li><li><a href="https://www.lvmh.com">LVMH</a> uses its perfume production lines to start making hand sanitiser to protect people against the coronavirus outbreak</li><li><a href="https://www.ihg.com/content/us/en/about/brands">IHG</a> is working with the government to protect the UK’s homeless from COVID-19. Rough sleepers known to homelessness charities will be relocated into IHG hotel rooms</li><li>Celebrity fitness coach, <a href="https://www.thebodycoach.com">Joe Wicks</a>, has become the nation’s PE teacher, holding live sessions at 9am from Monday to Friday. He plans to donate the&nbsp;£100,000 raised from his videos to the NHS – which my daughter and I (plus a million other households globally) have been exercising to every morning</li></ul>



<p>And&nbsp;lest we forget the charities on the front lines.&nbsp; Whilst these corporations are doing what they can to help us get through&nbsp;the&nbsp;COVID-19 crisis, non-profits like The Felix Project (which delivers food to the vulnerable across London) have never been busier.&nbsp; As volunteers continue to&nbsp;pour in, this wonderful group went&nbsp;from delivering 10 tonnes of food only a few weeks ago to delivering 27 tonnes a day to those in need.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we go forward together, I encourage you to consider what you can all do with your business, time and talents, just as we are. And if I can be a listening ear or offer some free advice in any capacity, I will be happy to hear from you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wishing you, your families and colleagues safety and health during these unprecedented times.&nbsp;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Positive influences outside of the travel sector will have a big impact on          how we travel next year. Purpose and intention permeate everything; 2020’s big trends are distinctly green minded, highlight the unsung destination and reveal new sides to old favourites. From eco-trips to off-season surprises – here are the trends you need to know about now.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class=""><tbody><tr><td><strong>TRAVEL TREND – GOING GREEN</strong></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Sustainable travel is the buzzword for 2020.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Resting in a small fishing village between mountain and sea,&nbsp;<strong>Gennadi Grand Resort</strong>&nbsp;in Rhodes is artfully designed with eco-sensibilities in mind. A synthesis of form, function and perfectly scaled structures in a nature-showcasing landscape, Gennadi Grand Resort operates under a BMS (Building Management System) comprising of leading innovative energy management technology. Slanted roofs simultaneously minimise sunlight reflection whilst optimising the microclimate conditions, with energy-saving glass panels, and forward-thinking recycling practices.<br></td></tr><tr><td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>TRAVEL TREND – PURPOSE LED TRAVEL</strong></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Consumption on its own isn’t cool anymore. Aiming to counteract the negative impact flying has on the environment, travellers in 2020 want to make those emissions count. Reconnecting with loved ones, soul-enriching experiences, supporting local communities and adding to the greater good is a major focus for travellers in the year ahead. &nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fairmont Maldives Sirru Fen Fushi</strong>&nbsp;teaches guests and actively encourage them to participate in regenerating&nbsp;the coral reef and improving sea life as part of an&nbsp;underwater art installation and coral regeneration project – the Coralarium. Designed by acclaimed British eco-artist Jason deCaires Taylor, guests are led through the living installation by the resort’s resident marine biologist before planting their own coral as part of their effort to reinvigorate local sea life.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>TRAVEL TREND: OFF-SEASON SURPRISES</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>&nbsp;</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Savvy travellers in 2020 know that certain hotspots are superior off season.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Spring is the perfect time of year to enjoy the secluded coves and beaches of Ibiza before the madness of summer kicks off. Coastal paths are blooming with blossoms and the legendary beach bars are laid-back, not packed. Adding to the many reasons to go,&nbsp;<strong>Nobu Hotel Ibiza Bay</strong>&nbsp;recently launched a range of ultra-personalised experiences, allowing guests to discover ‘My-Biza’ in their own way. Curated picnics are delivered to scenic spots, and Bali-bed butlers can bring everything from iced towels to turmeric shots and fresh sushi rolls whilst guests admire unobstructed sea views.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are one-to-one diving expeditions with a marine biologist and bespoke yacht trips to showcase the island’s insider spots and prettiest bays.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>While tourist numbers subside and the flight costs fall, Mallorca’s balmy temperatures remain long into the Autumn. Stylish&nbsp;<strong>Zafiro Palace Hotels</strong>&nbsp;are tucked in different corners of the island, making these luxurious resorts the perfect base to explore some of the off-season gems such as nearby, family-run wineries.
