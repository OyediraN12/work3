								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While we know the all too familiar ‘Fear Of Missing Out’, many of us are grappling with the opposite right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>FOGO&nbsp;</em>&#8211; aka the ‘Fear of Going Out’ &#8211; is a consequence of the coronavirus anxiety increasingly common following the social distancing measures we’ve all been adhering to this year. </p>



<p>After months of isolation, anxiety about reengaging with the wider world and living with a fear of contagion and adapting lifestyles to a new norm is overwhelming. Award-wining hypnotherapist and life coach,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hypnosis-in-london.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Malminder Gill</a>&nbsp;offers 5 techniques to ease the transition:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rsz_img_0125.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3267" srcset="https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rsz_img_0125.jpg 1024w, https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rsz_img_0125-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2><strong>Take it Gradually</strong></h2>



<p>We are undergoing a second disruptive change of lifestyle: take your time to figure out how to incorporate new habits into your routine. ‘Going back to normal’ is meant to be a process. Nobody is asking you to return to your pre-lockdown life straightaway, rather introduce changes to your lifestyle weekly.</p>



<h2><strong>Cultivate Positivity</strong></h2>



<p>To help with managing stress, avoiding unnecessary panic and reducing&nbsp;anxiety, an effective exercise is to repeat affirmations and mantras such as ‘<em>I trust my body’s internal wisdom</em>’<em>; ‘Although I can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel I know it’s there’;‘I’m choosing to see the positive in each and every day’</em>. Malminder guides those suffering doing so in her&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hypnotherapy.thinkific.com/courses/Manage-Coronavirus-Anxiety" target="_blank">free&nbsp;online programme</a>&nbsp;‘Manage Coronavirus&nbsp;Anxiety’, where she combines different relaxation techniques including deep breathing.</p>



<h2><strong>Create Certainties</strong></h2>



<p>The current situation has forced us to navigate through uncertainty, causing our anxiety levels to peak. Try to find ways of feeling in control again,&nbsp; these may be simple actions like starting a day with a run or grabbing your to-go breakfast at your local café.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rsz_carl-barcelo-nquhqkuvj3c-unsplash.jpg" alt="" data-id="3268" data-full-url="https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rsz_carl-barcelo-nquhqkuvj3c-unsplash.jpg" data-link="https://www.foxcomms.com/?attachment_id=3268" class="wp-image-3268" srcset="https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rsz_carl-barcelo-nquhqkuvj3c-unsplash.jpg 1024w, https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rsz_carl-barcelo-nquhqkuvj3c-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></li></ul></figure>



<h2><strong>Boost Your Immune System</strong></h2>



<p>To counteract the negative effect of anxiety on the immune system, make sure you are getting enough sleep, eating plenty of nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables and staying active.</p>



<h2><strong>Set Priorities</strong></h2>



<p>To make this transition easier, it is helpful to have a clear picture of what your priorities are going to be. Write them down and outline how you can achieve them.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Leisure travel might be on hold for now, but who isn’t dreaming of the day we can step off a plane into paradise in the not too distant future? One of Britons most visited and loved short-haul destinations, Mallorca, is teeming with cultural sites, stunning beaches, and blessed with 300 sunny days per year. </p>



<p>With so much to offer from family fun to mood-boosting experiences, <a href="http://www.zafirohotels.com/">Zafiro Hotels</a> – the family-run brand that reshaped hospitality in the Balearics with its ‘freedom of choice’ approach is the ideal base to discover Mallorca. </p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Here are 10 reasons why Mallorca should be top of your list</strong></h2>



<h4><strong>Scenic Cycling</strong> &nbsp;</h4>



<p>Widely considered to be one of the finest cycling destinations in Europe, with its own cycle station complete with bike rental, storage and curated routes for all levels, <a href="https://www.zafirohotels.com/hoteles/zafiro-palace-alcudia/?gclid=CjwKCAjwvtX0BRAFEiwAGWJyZExvyPNbZElenqtRGryuf5B2xxN2TncVwXMZeFAOyAZiwP1mBl3sWhoCE10QAvD_BwE">Zafiro Palace Alcùdia</a> provides the perfect base to explore Mallorca’s well-kept roads and mix of flat and mountainous terrain.</p>



<h4><strong>Natural Wonders</strong> </h4>



<p>Famous for its pristine beaches boasting crystalline waters and soft white sand, Mallorca has 29 beaches awarded the high accolade of the ‘Blue Flag’. And those preferring a bucolic landscape must hike <em>Serra de Tramuntana</em>, a mountain range packed with rocky ravines and twisting coastal pathways declared World Heritage Site by UNESCO. </p>



<h4><strong>Family Fun</strong></h4>



<p>Families seeking togetherness will be astounded by the kids-friendly hospitality at <a href="https://www.zafirohotels.com/hoteles/zafiro-palace-palmanova/">Zafiro Palace Palmanova</a>. The resort features specially designed pools for children, a pirate ship and giant ‘Water Bubble’ in the pool and is located just 20’ away from Palma Aquarium, where little guests can swim with stingrays or – for the bravest – sharks!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/rsz_beach-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3202" srcset="https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/rsz_beach-1.png 800w, https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/rsz_beach-1-768x504.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<h4><strong>Golfing Paradise</strong></h4>



<p>With over 20 golf courses, Mallorca’s multi-facetted landscape and perfect climate make it a premium destination for golfing holidays. Just steps away from the prestigious Andratx Golf Club, the newest five-star Zafiro Hotel’s property; <a href="https://www.zafirohotels.com/hoteles/zafiro-palace-andratx/">Zafiro Palace Andratx</a> will open its doors later this year. </p>



<h4><strong>Soaring Wine Destination</strong></h4>



<p>Between Zafiro Palace Palmanova and Zafiro Palace Alcùdia, the rural town of Binissalem has been ranked Mallorca’s top destination&nbsp;for&nbsp;the wine <em>aficionados</em>. From the village departs the Gourmet Train &amp; Wine Tour, that will bring wine buffs around the region’s best vineyards and <em>bodegas.</em></p>



<h4><strong>Sensational Palma</strong></h4>



<p>Not just a seaside city but a real open-air museum, the history-rich capital of Mallorca boasts stunning landmarks such as La Seu Cathedral and the <em>Banys Arabs </em>(Moorish Bathhouse). Get lost in the labyrinthine streets of the Old Town and discover hidden taverns and craft shops. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.foxcomms.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/rsz_bedroom.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3203"/></figure>



<h4><strong>Surrealistic Art Scene</strong></h4>



<p>Visit <em>Fundació Pilar i Joan Miró</em>, where a wide collection of works of art by the renowned Spanish surrealist Joan Miró, who spent most of his life in the island, is treasured. Mirò-inspired masterpieces by contemporary artists Alexander Calder and Dennis Oppenheim are also nestled in the Old Town.</p>



<h4><strong>Gourmet Dining</strong> </h4>



<p>Well known for its superb cuisine with top-quality restaurants scattered across the island, Mallorca is on every <em>bon vivants</em>’ radar. At the Zafiro Palace hotels, guests will be spoilt for choice with five gourmet restaurants boasting a wide choice of selections, from local Spanish cuisine to farther afield Mediterranean and Asian specialities.</p>



<h4><strong>Balearic Island Hopping</strong></h4>



<p>The Balearic Archipelago is made up of four very different islands; Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, and Formentera. From Puerto de Alcùdia in Northern Mallorca, travellers can ferry to the wild isle of Menorca with its cobalt blue inlets, while from Palma de Mallorca is easy to reach vibrant Ibiza for a day of shopping at the iconic Las Dalias Market.</p>



<h4><strong>Romantic Moments</strong></h4>



<p>Designed with couples in mind, Zafiro Palace Alcùdia’s sophisticated Junior Penthouse Suites come with a top floor terrace, complete with a Jacuzzi and Bali bed for the ultimate in privacy and relaxation. Lovers can enjoy an evening boat rides departing from Puerto de Alcùdia and soak up the beauty of the Mallorcan sunsets. </p>

<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Cooking, Creating, Exploring and Painting in the World’s Most Compelling Destinations</h3>



<p><strong>Luxury Learning Escapes</strong>: When it’s safe to venture overseas, travellers will want to make it count – immersing themselves in the local culture, helping the local economy, exploring in a meaningful way or learning something new. These luxury hotels don’t just boast sandy beaches and sea views, but a variety of unique experiences that offer travellers a new-found skill or knowledge – from diving for pearls in Bahrain and painting and tasting fine wines in the Maldives.</p>



<h3><strong>Learn to be a…Pearl Diver</strong></h3>



<p>Once the heart of the global pearl industry, Bahrain’s cultural
heritage is back in the spotlight as the country puts itself back on the map as
the alternative, luxury bucket list destination in the Middle East. Brimming
with history and culture, the sunny archipelago of 33 islands welcomes
travellers seeking to learn everything about pearls and fine metals.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/middle-east/bahrain" target="_blank"><strong>The Ritz-Carlton, Bahrain</strong></a> – set within 20 acres of lush gardens and golden sandy beaches on the Gulf of Arabia &#8211; has designed a special pearl diving excursion for guests willing to take part in the centuries-old activity; after boarding the resort’s luxurious Pearl1, venture out to sea, don a snorkel and dive toward the seabed in search of the Kingdom’s iridescent gem. Take your loot back to the surface and open the oyster’s decadent shell &#8211; explorers lucky enough to find a pearl can take it home as a keepsake or head to the souks and have it made into a delicate ring wrapped with Bahraini gold.</p>



<p>For more information or to book please visit <a href="http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/middle-east/bahrain">www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/middle-east/bahrain</a></p>



<h3><strong>Learn to be a…Nikkei Cuisine Chef</strong></h3>



<p>A new addition to the Zafiro Hotels portfolio, the new all-suite <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.zafirohotels.com/en/hotels/zafiro-palace-andratx/?wgu=13173_16644_15895429161786_796e940c94&amp;wgexpiry=1597318916&amp;clickid=13173_16644_15895429161786_796e940c94&amp;src=af&amp;_affclk=wges:16644:::200cuc13173_16644_15895429161786_796e940c94.f89Stg" target="_blank">Zafiro Palace Andratx</a> </strong>will bring a breath of fresh air to the Mallorcan coastline. Its stylish contemporary design stands out from the crowd, and its mouth-watering gourmet offering will surprise <em>bon vivants</em> from around the world. Jan René Brack – the Head Chef of the new resort &#8211; will introduce guests to Nikkei Cuisine, the culinary style that results from mixing Japanese traditions and recipes with Peruvian ingredients &#8211; typically fish, quinoa and <em>aji amarillo</em> peppers.</p>



<p>Grown up in South American from European parents, Brack will be
the perfect&nbsp;<em>maestro</em>&nbsp;for those willing to learn Peruvian
classic dishes like<em>&nbsp;Lomo Saltado</em>&nbsp;– a tasteful Sirloin stir-fry
&#8211;&nbsp;<em>Ceviche</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8211; a delicious and simple dish of raw fish
marinated in lime juice &#8211; and&nbsp;<em>Tiraditos</em>&nbsp;– a raw fish dish
similar to Japanese sashimi, but dressed in a spicy sauce. Families or small
groups can reserve a cooking lesson with the Head Chef in the stunning setting
of La Veranda terrace, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. After the class,
guests will also be shown the secrets of a Pisco Sour, the perfect cocktail to
accompany the Nikkei delicacies they have been preparing.</p>

<h3><strong>Learn to be a…Painter, Drawer and Sculptor</strong></h3>



<p>An island inspired by art, <strong><a href="http://fairmont.com/maldives">Fairmont Maldives Sirru Fen Fushi</a> </strong>offers guests the chance to get creative in paradise, either in the on-site art studio, or in the privacy of their own luxury villa in one-to-one lessons guided by a resident artist. Art-enthusiasts of all ages are given the tools, materials and skills needed to pain, sculpt or draw their own marine-inspired masterpieces, inspired by the abundance of natural beauty of the island surroundings.</p>



<p>Travellers can try their hand at coconut, canvas or wood painting, before learning how to make their own clay or wood sculptures. Bespoke crafting activities mean guests can create something special to take home; from designing a dream catcher and weaving authentic Maldivian rugs, to making jewellery from seashells. Fairmont Maldives is designed with sustainability in mind, educating guests on the importance of marine conservation through underwater art tours of the <a href="https://www.foxcomms.com/2020/04/earth-day-2020-the-brands-doing-their-bit-for-the-planet/">Coralarium</a>, a tidal art gallery and coral regeneration project, educational workshops and art with natural materials.</p>

A magical world full of culture and beauty – the luxury <a href="http://essaadi.com"><strong>Es Saadi Marrakech Resort</strong></a> provides the perfect setting to do just that. A window into this beautiful culture, Es Saadi is home to a vast collection of local artwork, a library and offers a large range of educational classes and tours of the property and the city so that visitors can learn about something, whether the culture, the fashion or the language.</p>



<p>An oasis of tranquillity in the heart of Marrakech’s Golden
Triangle, the resort looks out onto the snow-capped Atlas Mountains, near the
bustling souks and Jemaa El Fnaa square. The resort’s majestic palace offers 92
suites and 10 private luxury villas dotted around the gardens, as well as 8
Ksars (two-storey Berber-style cottages well suited to families) surrounding
the pool.</p>

nestled within the constellation of islands that form the Noonu Atoll in the
Maldives and takes exclusivity to the next level with facilities and service
that go beyond traditional resorts. Meaning “Turtle Island” in the local

nest and hatch.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="http://globetrender.com/">Globetrender</a>, a digital magazine and travel trend forecasting agency, has published its first, <em>Future of Luxury Travel Forecast: 2020-2025</em>, in association with Cookson Adventures, the leading specialists in ultra-luxury experiential travel, with a focus on conservation and sustainability.  </p>



<p>The inaugural report was unveiled at an event held at The Conduit, London on Tuesday 11<sup>th</sup> February, in partnership with Fox Communications and Verb Brands. Highlighting key findings of the forecast, the event also included a panel discussion with John O’Ceallaigh, consultant and founder of <em>Lute</em>, Tom Marchant, co-founder of <em>Black Tomato</em>, Thierry Teyssier, founder of <em>700,000 Heures </em>and Nigel Goode, designer and director Of <em>PriestmanGoode</em>.</p>



<p>From Space Tourism and Immortality Retreats, to Radical Sabbaticals and Ephemeral Hotels, the 70-plus page report reveals 25 eye-opening, highly specific macro trends that are setting the agenda for the next five years of luxury travel. It also shares interviews with industry innovators and thought leaders who reveal their insights and predictions for the years ahead.</p>



<p>The report, which costs £195 to download from globetrender.com, comes at a time when the luxury travel industry is facing impressive growth. According to <a href="https://globetrender.com/downloads/future-of-luxury-travel-forecast-2020-2025/">Grand View Research, Inc</a>, the luxury travel industry will be worth more than US$2.5 trillion by 2025, up from US$1.8 trillion in 2018.</p>



<p>This is a consequence not only of a growing number of worldwide millionaires and billionaires, but the rise of the middle classes, who are becoming ever-more wealthy and aspirational. The new decade will also see a huge shift away from materialism to experientialism as drivers of status, which only heightens the value of travel.</p>



<p>Jenny Southan, Globetrender’s editor and founder, said: “A few decades ago, most people agreed luxury travel meant staying in five-star hotels, eating in Michelin-star restaurants and riding around in limousines, things that were only attainable to the truly monied. Now, it is no longer satisfying to be isolated and pampered in a way that means they rarely engage with the ‘real world’ around them.</p>



<p>“Today, not only has luxury travel been democratised to some
degree but the very definition of it has become expanded. In the 2020s, it will
be trips that offer life enhancement, inner transformation, cultural
appreciation and physical graft that hold the most desire and social currency.
Wealthy travellers are becoming more intrepid, even going so far as to seek
discomfort.</p>



<p>“The trends we have identified in this report all reflect these things in different ways, whether it’s seeking out time in the wilderness, taking extended career breaks to travel the world, working on conservation projects or going into space.”</p>



<p>Luxury travel journalist, consultant and co-author of the Globetrender <em>Future of Luxury Travel Forecast: 2020-2025</em>, John O’Ceallaigh, said: “The old conventions and standards that defined luxury travel are losing ground as trailblazers and disruptors respond to changing consumer sentiments and demands with new initiatives and innovations. </p>



<p>“Researching and co-authoring this report served as a powerful reminder for me that change is full of opportunity and true creativity and credibility is rewarded. That seismic change is going to ripple through the luxury-travel sector in the coming years is a certainty – it&#8217;s an exciting time for the industry.”</p>



<h2>Here are excerpts from three defining luxury travel trends for 2020-2025: </h2>



<h4>Space Tourism</h4>



<p>Space tourism
is undeniably the most thrilling luxury travel trend for the new decade,
offering private citizens the chance to take part in truly revolutionary
extra-terrestrial journeys, without having to train to become professional
astronauts.</p>



<p>Having unveiled its Spaceport America departure terminal in 2019, as well as civilian space suits designed by Under Armour, Virgin Galactic plans to launch debut flights to the edge of space, 50 miles up, in 2020. Meanwhile, Zero To Infinity envisions taking people on a 4.5-hour journey, 22 miles above Earth, in a zero-emission helium balloon called Bloon by the end of 2021. </p>



<h4>Radical Sabbaticals</h4>



<p>In response
to increasing demand for career breaks with purpose, London-based tour operator
Original Travel has developed a sabbatical division and constructs extended
itineraries that focus on specific goals, be they finally learning to dance the
tango with the experts in Argentina or assisting a turtle-conservation project
in Costa Rica. They typically last from three to 12 months. </p>



<p>Aardvark Safaris’ so called “sensational sabbaticals” similarly emphasise environmentalism and sustainability, and might involve a months-long expedition through African reserves to assist at a Kenyan rhino sanctuary before joining the team at Singita’s offering in Tanzania to learn more about the latest anti-poaching strategies. </p>



<h4><strong>Ephemeral Hotels</strong></h4>



<p>Luxury thrives when it provides a sense of exclusivity, so what could be more desirable than a never-to-be-repeated hotel, resort or glamping stay that is yours alone? A number of emerging limited-edition accommodation concepts have made this thought a central tenet of their offering, and are delivering their privileged guests a range of hyper-personalised experiences while they’re in residence, to boot.  Take 700,000 Heures, which emerged – discreetly – as the “world’s first wandering hotel” in late 2018. Every six months, the concept “pops up” in a unique and remarkable private abode for a one-off residency. In 2020, it will be going to Japan, taking over an historic temple in Koyasan and a traditional house in a fishing village, with stays costing €2,500 a night.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With its Italian, Venetian and Austrian influences,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.istra.hr/">Istria</a>&nbsp;&#8211; a strawberry-shaped peninsula in the far north of Croatia – has rich culinary traditions and is a paradise for food-enthused explorers. Only a short, two-hour flight from London, &nbsp;sip, savour and sample the best Istria has to offer, whether it’s unearthing indigenous grape varieties at local vineyards, hunting for the treasured white truffle or feasting on fresh Adriatic seafood in Croatia’s first Michelin-starred restaurant.</p>



<p><strong>Truffle Hunting</strong></p>



<p>White and black truffle varieties reside in the Istrian ‘Bermuda’ triangle between Pazin, Buje and Buzet, thriving in the valley of the river Mirna and Motovun Forest, where the earth is rich in minerals. In fact, Istria holds the record for the largest truffle ever foraged and is the only place in the world where both high quality white and black varieties can be found.&nbsp;Those who want to impress back home with truffle-infused flavours can embark on a truffle hunting tour with sharp nosed hounds to forage for the Istrian delicacy. Back in the kitchen, accompanied by the Karlic family, use your freshly foraged truffles to pepper a rich risotto, infuse a homemade pasta dish or season a regional olive oil.</p>



<p><strong>Istrian Wine: From Grape to Glass</strong></p>



<p>The triangular shape of the Istrian peninsula looks rather like a bunch of grapes – and given the strong vinicultural heritage of the region – some say this is no coincidence. Unbeknown to many, the culture-rich region plays home to some of Croatia’s top wineries, housing soaring vistas of vines producing Merlot, Malvasia and more. Whilst exploring local wineries, budding connoisseurs are invited to taste Teran, the region’s most popular red wine, typically deep ruby in colour and often blended with other grapes. Fruity, fresh and fragrant, and one of the oldest grapes in Croatia, Malvazija dates back to Ancient Greece, and is the most common white wine in Croatia.</p>



<p><strong>Age-Old Olive Oil Trails</strong></p>



<p>Hailed by epicurean explorers as the ‘new Tuscany’, Istria is famed for its fresh Adriatic seafood and favourable Mediterranean climate. People appreciate and understand the local ingredients, delight in their home-cooked delicacies and proudly protect family recipes, passed down through generations. Dating back through centuries, and perhaps the most highly valued Istrian ingredient, is the olive oil; rich, peppery and on par with that produced in Tuscany. The region has been dubbed best in the world for olive oil production for three consecutive years, and plays home to Roman-era olive trees; one of the oldest grows in Brijuni National&nbsp;Park, a cluster of islands off the coast of Pula.</p>
